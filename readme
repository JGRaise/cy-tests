### This is a short into to the Cypress project


Cypress framework is a JavaScript-based end-to-end testing framework built on top of Mocha â€“ a feature-rich JavaScript test framework running on and in the browser, making asynchronous testing simple and convenient. It also uses a BDD/TDD assertion library and a browser to pair with any JavaScript testing framework.


Currently we have started with basic API requests for brands API using different clients - i&i and OB.


### PREPARATION ###


Note: Since node_modules folder has a LOT of files and does not need to be updated at all, it't not included in the repo.

In order to have everything locally you need to:

0. Pull the repo to your device
1. Have 'npm' on your device
2. Initialize it in the folder with repo by command > npm init <
3. Navigate to the repo's folder
4. Install Cypress with command > install cypress --save-dev <
5. It's possible to run Cypress now in two ways:
- headless with > ./node_modules/.bin/cypress run <
- with browser preview with > ./node_modules/.bin/cypress open <
